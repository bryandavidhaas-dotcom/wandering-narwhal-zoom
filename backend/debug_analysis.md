# 🚨 Critical Issues Found in Real User Testing

## Terminal Output Analysis (Bryan's Profile)

From the backend logs, I can see several major problems:

### **Issue 1: Resume/LinkedIn Data Not Being Used**
```
📄 Resume insights: {'skills': [], 'experience_indicators': [], 'leadership_indicators': [], 'industry_indicators': []} 
💼 LinkedIn insights: {'profile_strength': 'active', 'network_indicators': [], 'activity_indicators': []}
```
**Problem**: All arrays are EMPTY. The system isn't extracting any meaningful data from resume/LinkedIn fields.

### **Issue 2: Zone Logic is Broken**
```
🎯 Generated 9 recommendations: 4 safe, 3 stretch, 2 adventure
```
**Problem**: Bryan reported seeing the SAME 9 recommendations in all 3 zones, but the backend thinks it's generating different counts per zone.

### **Issue 3: No Product Management Recognition**
```
📊 User profile: experience=20+, skills=8, exploration_level=1
```
**Problem**: The system sees "20+ years experience" but doesn't know it's PRODUCT MANAGEMENT experience.

### **Issue 4: Generic Filtering Only**
```
🔍 Filtered careers: 17 careers match experience and salary criteria
```
**Problem**: Only using experience years + salary. Not using role, industry, or assessment answers.

## Root Cause Analysis

### **Frontend Data Issues:**
1. **Resume Text**: Likely empty or not being sent
2. **Current Role**: Not being captured or processed
3. **Assessment Answers**: Not being used for career matching

### **Backend Processing Issues:**
1. **Resume Parsing**: `extract_resume_insights()` returning empty arrays
2. **Career Matching**: Only using experience years, ignoring role/industry
3. **Zone Logic**: Frontend showing same recommendations despite backend generating different zones

## Next Steps

1. **Get the actual request payload** to see what data frontend is sending
2. **Fix resume/LinkedIn parsing** to extract meaningful insights
3. **Add role-based matching** so Product Management experience → Product careers
4. **Debug zone display logic** in frontend
