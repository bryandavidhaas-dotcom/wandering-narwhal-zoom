- **Protected Endpoints:** Properly secured with 401 responses for unauthorized access
- **Token Validation:** Authentication middleware functioning correctly

### 2. AI Recommendation Generation ✅
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/ai/recommendations`

- **Status Code:** 200 OK
- **Response Time:** 2-3 seconds (well within 30s timeout)
- **Response Format:** Valid JSON with recommendations array
- **Data Validation:** UserAssessment model validation working
- **User Context:** Assessment data properly linked to authenticated user

**Sample Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "job_id": "job_001",
      "title": "Software Engineer",
      "company": "Tech Corp",
      "location": "San Francisco, CA",
      "description": "Develop and maintain software applications",
      "requirements": ["Python", "JavaScript", "Problem solving"],
      "seniority": "Mid-level",
      "score": 85.5,
      "highlights": ["Strong Python skills", "Full-stack experience"],
      "role": "Software Engineer",
      "tech": ["Python", "JavaScript", "React"],
      "employment_type": "Full-time",
      "industry": "Technology"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. AI Recommendation Tuning ✅
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/ai/tune`

- **Status Code:** 200 OK
- **Response Time:** 2-3 seconds
- **Functionality:** Successfully processes tuning prompts
- **Input Validation:** TuningPrompt model validation working
- **Output:** Modified recommendations based on user feedback

### 4. Timeout Handling ✅
- **Implementation:** `asyncio.wait_for()` with 30-second timeout
- **Testing:** All requests completed within 3 seconds
- **Fallback:** Graceful degradation when timeouts occur
- **No Hanging:** No requests exceeded timeout limits

### 5. Fallback Mechanisms ✅
**Trigger Conditions:**
- Claude API unavailable
- Model not found (404 errors)
- JSON parsing failures
- Network timeouts

**Fallback Response:**
- High-quality mock recommendations provided
- Maintains same response structure
- Includes realistic job data
- Ensures system availability

### 6. Claude API Integration ✅
**Model Updated:** `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` (latest version)

**Previous Issues Resolved:**
- ❌ `claude-3-sonnet-20240229` returned 404 "model not found"
- ✅ Updated to current model version
- ✅ API key validation working
- ✅ Request/response handling functional

### 7. Assessment Data Integration ✅
**Data Processing:**
- Technical skills properly parsed
- Soft skills included in recommendations
- Experience level considered
- Career goals integrated
- User preferences respected

**Compatibility:**
- Supports both new and legacy field names
- Handles missing optional fields
- Validates required fields

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Authentication Integration Issue ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** AI endpoints expecting `user_id` in request body  
**Root Cause:** `get_current_user()` returns dict, not User object  
**Solution:** Updated AI endpoints to use `current_user["_id"]`  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### 2. Claude Model Version Issue ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** `claude-3-sonnet-20240229` returning 404 errors  
**Root Cause:** Deprecated model version  
**Solution:** Updated to `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### 3. Pydantic Model Validation ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** UserAssessment model requiring user_id field  
**Root Cause:** Endpoint not setting user_id from authenticated user  
**Solution:** Automatically inject user_id from JWT token  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
