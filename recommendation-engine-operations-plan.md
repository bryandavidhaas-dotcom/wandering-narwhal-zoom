# Recommendation Engine: Operations Plan

This document outlines the operational strategies for ensuring the performance, scalability, and maintainability of the career recommendation engine.

## 1. Performance and Scalability Plan

### 1.1 Caching

A multi-layered caching strategy will be implemented to minimize latency and reduce the load on backend services.

- **Data to Cache:**
  - **Career Data:** Static data such as career paths, required skills, and salary ranges will be cached.
  - **Skill Graph:** The relationships between skills will be cached to speed up skill-based filtering.
  - **User Profile:** Hot user profiles (frequently accessed) will be cached to reduce database lookups.
  - **Recommendation Results:** The results of recommendation queries can be cached for a short period to handle repeated requests.

- **Caching Technology:**
  - **In-Memory Cache:** [Redis](https://redis.io/) is recommended for its high performance and support for various data structures. It can be used for caching user profiles and recommendation results.
  - **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** A CDN can be used to cache static assets like career data and skill graphs closer to the user.

### 1.2 Asynchronous Processing

Long-running tasks will be processed asynchronously to avoid blocking the user interface and improve the user experience.

- **Tasks to Process Asynchronously:**
  - **Resume/LinkedIn Parsing:** Ingesting and parsing user documents can be time-consuming. This will be handled by a background job.
  - **Model Training/Updating:** If the recommendation engine uses machine learning models, they will be trained and updated offline.
  - **Bulk Data Imports:** Importing large datasets of career or skill information will be done asynchronously.

- **Implementation:**
  - A message queue (e.g., [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) or [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)) will be used to manage asynchronous tasks. The `Data Ingestion Service` will publish jobs to the queue, and dedicated worker services will process them.

### 1.3 Scalability

The microservices architecture allows for horizontal scaling of individual services based on demand.

- **Recommendation Service:** The `Recommendation Service` is stateless and can be scaled horizontally by running multiple instances behind a load balancer.
- **Databases:**
  - **Read Replicas:** Read replicas can be used for the `Career Data DB` and `User Profile DB` to distribute read traffic.
  - **Sharding:** For very large datasets, the databases can be sharded to distribute data across multiple servers.
- **Autoscaling:** Cloud-based autoscaling groups can be configured to automatically adjust the number of service instances based on traffic patterns.

## 2. Configuration Version Control Strategy

The recommendation engine's configuration (weights, thresholds, rules) is critical to its behavior and must be managed systematically.

### 2.1 Storage

- **Git Repository:** The configuration will be stored in a dedicated Git repository. This provides a clear audit trail, version history, and the ability to manage changes through pull requests.
  - **Format:** Configuration will be stored in a human-readable format like YAML or JSON.

### 2.2 Change Management Workflow

1.  **Branching:** A developer creates a new branch to propose a change to the configuration.
2.  **Pull Request:** The developer opens a pull request with the proposed changes.
3.  **Review and Approval:** The pull request is reviewed by at least one other team member. This review should include an assessment of the potential impact of the change.
4.  **Automated Testing:** Automated tests are run to validate the new configuration and ensure it doesn't introduce any regressions.
5.  **Merging:** Once approved and tested, the pull request is merged into the main branch.

### 2.3 Configuration Deployment and Rollbacks

- **Config Service:** The `Config Service` (as defined in the architecture document) will be responsible for fetching and serving the configuration.
- **Versioning:**
  - Each merge to the main branch will trigger a new version of the configuration to be published.
  - The `Config Service` will be able to serve specific versions of the configuration.
- **Fetching:** The `Recommendation Service` will fetch the configuration from the `Config Service` at startup and can be configured to periodically refresh its configuration.
- **Rollbacks:** If a new configuration causes problems, the `Config Service` can be quickly configured to serve a previous, stable version.
- **A/B Testing:** The `Config Service` can be designed to serve different versions of the configuration to different users, enabling A/B testing of new recommendation algorithms or parameters.
