# Next Steps: Implementing the New Recommendation Engine Architecture

This document outlines the necessary code changes to implement the new multi-step architecture in the `recommendation-engine/engine.py` file.

## 1. New Private Methods

The following private methods need to be added to the `RecommendationEngine` class:

### `_preprocess_user_profile`

This method will be responsible for summarizing the user's profile and resume.

```python
def _preprocess_user_profile(self, user_profile: UserProfile) -> Dict:
    """
    Summarizes the user's profile and resume using a dedicated LLM call.

    Args:
        user_profile: The user's full profile.

    Returns:
        A dictionary containing the summarized profile.
    """
    # This is a placeholder for the actual implementation.
    # In a real-world scenario, this method would make a call to an LLM
    # with a prompt designed for summarization.
    summary = {
        "key_skills": user_profile.technicalSkills,
        "experience_years": user_profile.experience,
        "primary_industry": user_profile.industries[0] if user_profile.industries else "",
        "career_goals": user_profile.careerGoals,
    }
    return summary
```

### `_prefilter_careers`

This method will implement the lightweight, non-LLM pre-filtering logic.

```python
def _prefilter_careers(
    self,
    summarized_profile: Dict,
    available_careers: List[Career],
) -> List[Career]:
    """
    Prefilters the list of available careers based on the summarized profile.

    Args:
        summarized_profile: The summarized user profile.
        available_careers: The full list of available careers.

    Returns:
        A filtered list of candidate careers.
    """
    # This is a placeholder for the actual implementation.
    # A more sophisticated implementation would involve keyword matching,
    # skill overlap calculation, and industry filtering.
    return available_careers[:200]  # Simulate filtering to 200 careers
```

## 2. Modified `get_recommendations` Method

The `get_recommendations` method needs to be updated to orchestrate the new multi-step process.

```python
def get_recommendations(
    self,
    user_profile: UserProfile,
    available_careers: List[Career],
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    exploration_level: int = 3,
) -> List[CareerRecommendation]:
    """
    Generate career recommendations for a user using the new multi-step process.
    """
    # Step 1: Pre-process the user profile
    summarized_profile = self._preprocess_user_profile(user_profile)

    # Step 2: Pre-filter careers
    candidate_careers = self._prefilter_careers(
        summarized_profile, available_careers
    )

    # Step 3: Multi-call recommendation generation
    # This is a placeholder for the batch scoring and top candidate analysis logic.
    # This would involve multiple calls to the LLM with smaller batches of careers.
    
    # For now, we'll use the existing scoring and categorization engines
    # with the filtered list of careers.
    scores = self.scoring_engine.score_multiple_careers(
        user_profile, candidate_careers, exploration_level
    )
    recommendations = self.categorization_engine.categorize_recommendations(
        user_profile, candidate_careers, scores
    )

    # Step 4: Apply final limits and sorting
    recommendations.sort(key=lambda x: x.score.total_score, reverse=True)

    if limit:
        recommendations = recommendations[:limit]
    elif len(recommendations) > self.config.max_recommendations:
        recommendations = recommendations[: self.config.max_recommendations]

    return recommendations
```

## 3. Configuration Updates

The `RecommendationConfig` class (in `recommendation-engine/config.py`) should be updated to include new parameters for controlling the multi-step process.

```python
# In recommendation-engine/config.py

@dataclass
class RecommendationConfig:
    # ... existing configuration ...
    batch_size: int = 20
    top_n_candidates: int = 30
