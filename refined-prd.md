## 9. MVP SCOPE & DEFERRED FEATURES

*   **9.1 MVP Success Definition:**
    *   The core workflow, from user assessment to interactively refined recommendations, is fully functional and provides a valuable user experience.
*   **9.2 In Scope for MVP:**
    *   FR-001: AI-Powered Recommendation Generation
    *   FR-002: Interactive Recommendation Tuning
    *   FR-003: User Authentication

    *   **FR-004: Enhanced Data Ingestion (Resume Parsing)**
        *   **Description:** Automatically parsing user data from resumes to pre-fill the user assessment.
    *   **DF-002: Recommendation History**
        *   **Description:** Allowing users to view a history of their past `Recommendation Sets`.
        *   **Reason for Deferral:** A "nice-to-have" feature that is not critical for the initial core flow.
    *   **DF-004: Recommendation Set Deletion**
        *   **Description:** Allowing users to delete a `Recommendation Set`.
        *   **Reason for Deferral:** Not essential for the primary workflow of refinement.

## 10. ASSUMPTIONS & DECISIONS

*   **Key Assumptions Made:**
    *   A suitable AI model is available and can be integrated via an API.
    *   For the MVP, manual user input is sufficient to test the core recommendation and tuning functionality.
*   **Questions Asked & Answers:**
    *   **Q:** Will we use existing assessment, login, and engagement pages?
    *   **A:** Yes, to be efficient, we will keep the existing user-experience and interface. A color scheme update is acceptable.
