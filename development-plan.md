# Development Plan: AI-Driven Recommendation Engine (Revised)

This document outlines the development plan for integrating and completing the AI-driven recommendation engine, as specified in `refined-prd.md`. It acknowledges the existing progress in the backend and focuses on the remaining work.

## Current Status

The backend already has a sophisticated `EnhancedRecommendationEngine` that handles filtering, scoring, and categorization. A `UnifiedRecommendationAPI` provides a structured interface for generating recommendations. The core logic for recommendation generation is largely in place.

## Revised Epics & User Stories

### Epic 1: Frontend Integration & UI Implementation

**Description:** Connect the existing frontend to the `UnifiedRecommendationAPI` and build the necessary UI components for the new features.

**User Stories:**

*   **Story 1.1:** As a developer, I need to adapt the frontend to send user assessment data to the `UnifiedRecommendationAPI`.
*   **Story 1.2:** As a user, I want to see my AI-generated recommendations on the results page, fetched from the new API.
*   **Story 1.3:** As a user, I want a chat interface on the results page to refine my recommendations.

### Epic 2: Interactive Recommendation Tuning

**Description:** Implement the real-time recommendation tuning feature using the existing backend capabilities.

**User Stories:**

*   **Story 2.1:** As a developer, I need to create a new API endpoint that uses the `EnhancedRecommendationEngine.refine_recommendations` method.
*   **Story 2.2:** As a user, I want to type a prompt into the chat interface and see the recommendation list update in real-time.
*   **Story 2.3:** As a user, I want to see a history of my conversation with the AI.

### Epic 3: Finalizing Data Models & Authentication

**Description:** Ensure all data is correctly modeled and that the existing authentication system is properly integrated.

**User Stories:**

*   **Story 3.1:** As a developer, I need to finalize the data models for `Tuning Interaction` and ensure they are stored correctly.
*   **Story 3.2:** As a developer, I need to verify that all new API endpoints are protected by the existing authentication system.

## Revised MVP Milestones

1.  **Milestone 1: Connect Frontend to Recommendation API**
    *   Update the frontend to call the `get_recommendations` endpoint in the `UnifiedRecommendationAPI`.
    *   Display the initial `Recommendation Set` on the results page.

2.  **Milestone 2: Implement Interactive Chat UI**
    *   Develop the chat interface on the results page.
    *   Create a new API endpoint for recommendation tuning that leverages the existing `refine_recommendations` method in the `EnhancedRecommendationEngine`.
    *   Connect the chat UI to the new tuning endpoint and ensure the results page updates dynamically.

3.  **Milestone 3: Finalize and Secure**
    *   Implement the conversation history for the chat interface.
    *   Ensure all new endpoints are secured with the existing authentication.
    *   Thoroughly test the end-to-end workflow.

## Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:** Existing React/Vite frontend
*   **Backend:** Existing Python/FastAPI backend with `EnhancedRecommendationEngine`
*   **Database:** Existing MongoDB
*   **AI Model:** The existing `refine_recommendations` method will be used for the MVP. A more advanced external AI model can be integrated later.
