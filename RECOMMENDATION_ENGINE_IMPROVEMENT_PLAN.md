# Recommendation Engine Improvement Plan

## 1. Proposed Architecture: Backend-Driven Logic

To address the scalability and consistency issues, the recommendation engine will be refactored to a backend-driven architecture. The backend will be the single source of truth for all recommendation logic, including career data, filtering, scoring, and categorization.

### 1.1. Backend Responsibilities

- **Centralized Career Database**: All career templates will be migrated from the frontend to a database managed by the backend. This will allow for dynamic updates and easier management of career data.
- **Unified Recommendation API**: The backend will expose a single, unified API for generating recommendations. This API will accept a user profile and return a list of categorized career recommendations.
- **Sole Authority for Business Logic**: All filtering, scoring, and categorization logic will be exclusively handled by the backend. The frontend will no longer contain any business rules related to recommendations.

### 1.2. Frontend Responsibilities

- **Presentation and User Interaction**: The frontend will be responsible for rendering the recommendations provided by the backend and managing user interactions.
- **API Integration**: The frontend will integrate with the new backend API to fetch recommendations. It will pass the user's assessment data to the backend and display the results.
- **Removal of Duplicated Logic**: All duplicated recommendation logic, including the hardcoded career templates and matching algorithms, will be removed from the `frontend/src/utils/careerMatching.ts` file.

## 2. Strategy for Improving Recommendation Accuracy

To improve the accuracy of recommendations, we will focus on enhancing the backend's categorization and scoring mechanisms.

### 2.1. Dynamic Career Categorization

The rigid, keyword-based categorization system in `categorization.py` will be replaced with a more dynamic and context-aware approach. This may involve:

- **Machine Learning-Based Categorization**: Implementing a machine learning model to classify careers based on their descriptions and required skills.
- **Ontology-Based Mapping**: Developing a career ontology to map relationships between different roles and industries, allowing for more nuanced recommendations.

### 2.2. Enhanced Filtering and Scoring

The filtering and scoring algorithms will be refined to better understand the user's profile and career goals. This will include:

- **Contextual Skill Matching**: Moving beyond simple keyword matching to a more sophisticated skill analysis that considers the context in which skills are applied.
- **Career Path Analysis**: Incorporating an understanding of typical career progressions to provide more relevant "stretch" and "adventure" recommendations.
- **User Feedback Loop**: Implementing a mechanism for users to provide feedback on recommendations, which can be used to continuously improve the accuracy of the engine.

## 3. Phased Implementation Plan

The implementation will be broken down into the following phases:

### Phase 1: Backend Refactoring

1.  **Migrate Career Data**: Move the hardcoded career templates from the frontend to a new database managed by the backend.
2.  **Develop Unified API**: Create the new backend API for generating recommendations.
3.  **Enhance Categorization**: Implement the new dynamic career categorization system.

### Phase 2: Frontend Refactoring

1.  **Integrate with New API**: Update the frontend to use the new backend API for fetching recommendations.
2.  **Remove Duplicated Logic**: Strip out all business logic from `frontend/src/utils/careerMatching.ts`.
3.  **UI/UX Enhancements**: Improve the user interface for displaying recommendations and collecting feedback.

### Phase 3: Continuous Improvement

1.  **Implement Feedback Loop**: Develop the system for collecting and incorporating user feedback.
2.  **Monitor and Refine**: Continuously monitor the performance of the recommendation engine and make iterative improvements to the algorithms.
