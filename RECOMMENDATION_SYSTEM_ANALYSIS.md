# Career Recommendation System: Technical Analysis & Weighting Documentation

## Executive Summary

Your career recommendation system is a sophisticated, multi-layered machine learning and algorithmic approach that combines weighted scoring, multi-stage filtering, and context-aware categorization. The system uses **no traditional machine learning models** but instead employs a **rule-based expert system** with mathematical scoring algorithms, weighted feature matching, and heuristic-based decision making.

## Core Architecture & Mechanisms

### 1. **Multi-Stage Pipeline Architecture**

The system follows a sophisticated 6-stage pipeline:

```
User Profile → Pre-filtering → Scoring → Categorization → Ranking → Final Selection
```

#### Stage 1: Profile Preprocessing
- **Mechanism**: Text summarization and data normalization
- **Purpose**: Reduces prompt size to prevent LLM token limits
- **Logic**: Extracts top 10 technical skills, 5 soft skills, 3 industries, 5 interests
- **Implementation**: [`_preprocess_user_profile()`](backend/recommendation_engine/engine.py:386)

#### Stage 2: Pre-filtering (Lightweight Scoring)
- **Mechanism**: Mathematical similarity scoring without LLM calls
- **Weights**: 
  - Skill matching: **40%**
  - Industry matching: **30%** 
  - Interest/keyword matching: **20%**
  - Title relevance: **10%**
- **Implementation**: [`_prefilter_careers()`](backend/recommendation_engine/engine.py:439)

#### Stage 3: Enhanced Filtering
- **Mechanism**: Multi-dimensional compatibility analysis
- **Factors**: Salary compatibility, experience level matching, skill overlap
- **Implementation**: [`FilterEngine.filter_careers()`](backend/recommendation_engine/filters.py:36)

#### Stage 4: Weighted Scoring Engine
- **Mechanism**: Comprehensive weighted scoring algorithm
- **Implementation**: [`ScoringEngine.score_career()`](backend/recommendation_engine/scoring.py:43)

#### Stage 5: Context-Aware Categorization
- **Mechanism**: Rule-based categorization into Safe/Stretch/Adventure zones
- **Implementation**: [`CategorizationEngine.categorize_recommendations()`](backend/recommendation_engine/categorization.py:209)

#### Stage 6: Final Ranking & Selection
- **Mechanism**: Score-based sorting with category-aware adjustments
- **Implementation**: [`RecommendationEngine.get_recommendations()`](backend/recommendation_engine/engine.py:63)

### 2. **Scoring Algorithm Deep Dive**

The core scoring mechanism is a **weighted linear combination** of four primary components:

```
Total Score = (Skill_Score × 0.4) + (Interest_Score × 0.25) + (Salary_Score × 0.2) + (Experience_Score × 0.15) - Consistency_Penalty
```

#### A. Skill Matching Algorithm (40% Weight)
**Mathematical Model**: Weighted Jaccard Similarity with Proficiency Matching

```python
skill_score = Σ(proficiency_match(user_skill, required_skill) × skill_weight) / total_weight
```

**Proficiency Matching Logic**:
- User level ≥ Required level: **1.0 score**
- User level < Required level: **max(0.0, 1.0 - (gap × 0.25))**
- Missing mandatory skills: **-0.5 penalty per skill**
- Certification bonus: **+0.1**
- Recent experience bonus: **+0.05**

**Implementation**: [`_calculate_skill_match_score()`](backend/recommendation_engine/scoring.py:110)

#### B. Interest Alignment Algorithm (25% Weight)
**Mathematical Model**: Weighted Keyword Matching

```python
interest_score = Σ(keyword_match × interest_level_weight) / total_weight
```

**Interest Level Weights**:
- Very High: **1.0**
- High: **0.75**
- Medium: **0.5**
- Low: **0.25**

**Implementation**: [`_calculate_interest_match_score()`](backend/recommendation_engine/scoring.py:167)

#### C. Salary Compatibility Algorithm (20% Weight)
**Mathematical Model**: Range Overlap Analysis

```python
if overlap_exists:
    salary_score = (user_overlap_ratio + career_overlap_ratio) / 2
else:
    salary_score = max(0.0, 1.0 - (gap / expected_salary))
```

**Special Cases**:
- No user expectations: **1.0 score**
- Currency mismatch: **0.8 score**
- Higher than expected: **Reduced penalty (gap / (expected × 2))**

**Implementation**: [`_calculate_salary_compatibility_score()`](backend/recommendation_engine/scoring.py:207)

#### D. Experience Matching Algorithm (15% Weight)
**Mathematical Model**: Experience Level Distance Calculation

```python
experience_levels = ["entry", "junior", "mid", "senior", "expert"]
distance = abs(user_level_index - career_level_index)
experience_score = max(0.4, 1.0 - (distance × 0.2))
```

**Implementation**: [`_calculate_experience_match_score()`](backend/recommendation_engine/scoring.py:256)

### 3. **Enhanced Career Field Categorization**

The system uses a **context-aware career field detection** algorithm that goes beyond simple keyword matching:

#### Field Detection Algorithm
**Mathematical Model**: Weighted Keyword Scoring with Context Awareness

```python
field_score = Σ(keyword_weight × context_multiplier × field_weight)
```

**Context Multipliers**:
- Exact title match: **3.0×**
- Description match: **2.0×**
- Secondary keyword match: **1.0×**
- Seniority context bonus: **+0.5**

**Field Categories with Weights**:
- Technology: **1.0**
- Healthcare: **1.5** (specialization bonus)
- Executive Leadership: **2.0** (high importance)
- Legal/Law: **1.3**
- Government: **1.2**
- Others: **1.0**

**Implementation**: [`get_enhanced_career_field()`](backend/recommendation_engine/enhanced_categorization.py:315)

### 4. **Consistency Penalty System**

The system applies penalties for career field mismatches based on user exploration preferences:

```python
penalty = base_penalty × exploration_multiplier
```

**Exploration Level Multipliers**:
- Level 1 (Conservative): **2.0×** penalty
- Level 2: **1.5×** penalty  
- Level 3 (Balanced): **1.0×** penalty
- Level 4: **0.7×** penalty
- Level 5 (Adventurous): **0.4×** penalty

**Base Penalty**: **0.3** (30% score reduction)
**Maximum Penalty**: **0.6** (60% score reduction)

**Implementation**: [`_calculate_consistency_penalty()`](backend/recommendation_engine/scoring.py:468)

### 5. **Categorization Logic**

Recommendations are categorized using a **multi-factor decision tree**:

#### Safe Zone Criteria
- Total score ≥ **0.7** AND skill score ≥ **0.8**
- OR same career field AND seniority gap ≤ 1 level

#### Stretch Zone Criteria  
- Total score ≥ **0.5** AND missing mandatory skills ≤ 2
- OR same/related field AND seniority gap ≤ 2 levels

#### Adventure Zone Criteria
- Total score ≥ **0.3**
- OR significant field change with learning potential

**Implementation**: [`_determine_enhanced_category()`](backend/recommendation_engine/enhanced_categorization.py:512)
