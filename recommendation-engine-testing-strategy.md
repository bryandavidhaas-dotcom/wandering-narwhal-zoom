# Recommendation Engine Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing and validation strategy for the recommendation engine. The goal is to ensure the engine provides accurate, relevant, and sensible career recommendations.

## 1. Unit Testing

### 1.1. Strategy

Unit tests will focus on isolating and testing individual components of the recommendation engine. This includes the functions within `filters.py`, `scoring.py`, and `categorization.py`. The Python `unittest` framework will be used to create and run these tests.

### 1.2. Test Cases

- **Filters (`filters.py`):**
  - Test that each filter correctly includes or excludes careers based on user preferences (e.g., `filter_by_interests`, `filter_by_personality`).
  - Test edge cases, such as empty career lists or user profiles with no preferences.
  - Test boundary conditions, like minimum and maximum values for numerical preferences.

- **Scoring (`scoring.py`):**
  - Test the `calculate_score` function with various user profiles and career templates to ensure scores are calculated as expected.
  - Test that weights and multipliers in `config.py` are applied correctly.
  - Test scenarios where scores should be zero or negative (if applicable).

- **Categorization (`categorization.py`):**
  - Test the `categorize_careers` function to ensure it correctly groups careers into the defined categories (e.g., "Top Recommendations," "Good Matches").
  - Test with different score distributions to verify that the categorization logic is robust.

## 2. Integration Testing

### 2.1. Strategy

Integration tests will verify that the components of the recommendation engine work together as a cohesive unit. The focus will be on the `RecommendationEngine` class in `engine.py`.

### 2.2. Scenarios

- **Mock Data:** The tests will use the mock data from `mock_data.py` to create realistic user profiles and career templates.
  - **Note:** The mock data should be expanded to include a diverse set of both professional and trade careers to ensure comprehensive test coverage.
- **End-to-End Testing:**
  - Create test cases that simulate the entire recommendation process, from creating a `RecommendationEngine` instance to generating the final recommendations.
  - Verify that the filters, scoring, and categorization steps are executed in the correct order and that the final output is as expected.
  - Test with a variety of user profiles to ensure the engine can handle different combinations of preferences and experiences.

## 3. Acceptance Testing (Golden Datasets)

### 3.1. Strategy

Acceptance testing will be performed using "golden datasets" that represent a benchmark for the engine's performance. These datasets will consist of user profiles and their expected career recommendations, as determined by domain experts.

### 3.2. Dataset Structure

Each golden dataset will be a JSON file containing:
- A user profile (e.g., interests, personality, skills).
- A list of expected career recommendations, including the career ID and the expected category (e.g., "Top Recommendation").
- **Note:** Golden datasets should be created for user profiles suited to both professional and trade careers to validate the engine's performance across different career types.

### 3.3. Maintenance

The golden datasets will be stored in a dedicated directory (e.g., `tests/golden_datasets`) and will be version-controlled. A script will be created to run the recommendation engine against these datasets and compare the output to the expected recommendations. Any discrepancies will be flagged for review.

## 4. Qualitative Evaluation

### 4.1. Strategy

A human-in-the-loop evaluation process will be established to gather qualitative feedback on the recommendations. This will involve creating a simple tool or script that allows domain experts to review and rate the quality of recommendations for a set of test profiles.

### 4.2. Evaluation Criteria

- **Relevance:** How well do the recommendations match the user's profile?
- **Sensibility:** Are the recommendations logical and realistic for the user?
- **Context-Awareness:** Does the engine consider the nuances of the user's background and preferences?

## 5. Performance Testing

### 5.1. Strategy

Performance testing will focus on measuring the efficiency of the recommendation engine.

### 5.2. Key Metrics

- **Average Response Time:** The average time it takes to generate recommendations for a single user profile.
- **Throughput:** The number of user profiles the engine can process per second.

### 5.3. Tools

Tools like Python's `timeit` module or `cProfile` can be used to measure the execution time of the recommendation process. For more comprehensive load testing, tools like Locust or JMeter could be considered.
