# Database Improvement Strategy and Implementation Plan

## 1. Implementation Roadmap

This roadmap outlines a phased approach to recover and enhance the career database system. It is designed to address the critical issues identified in the comprehensive analysis, transforming the current fragmented and corrupted data state into a robust, unified, and production-ready system.

### Phase 1: Emergency Recovery and Stabilization (Duration: 48 Hours)

**Objective:** Restore critical database functionality and eliminate user-facing placeholder content. This phase prioritizes immediate recovery and risk mitigation.

**Milestones:**

| Milestone | Deliverable | Success Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| **M1.1: Disable Placeholder Content** | Configuration change in the frontend application to disable the `new_career_data.json` data source. | The application no longer displays placeholder career data. All career-related features gracefully handle the absence of this data source. |
| **M1.2: Emergency Database Restore** | A new, clean MongoDB instance populated with data from `production_career_data.json`. | A fully functional MongoDB database containing all 361 records from the production JSON file. The data is queryable and passes basic integrity checks. |
| **M1.3: API Re-routing** | Backend API updated to connect to the new MongoDB database as the sole source of truth for career data. | All API endpoints for career data successfully read from and write to the new MongoDB database. The `careers.db` file is completely disconnected. |

**Technical Specifications:**

*   **Database:** MongoDB Atlas (M0 free tier for immediate deployment, scalable as needed).
*   **Recovery Script:** A Python script (`scripts/emergency_data_restore.py`) will be created to:
    *   Read `production_career_data.json`.
    *   Connect to the new MongoDB instance.
    *   Perform a bulk insert of the 361 records.
    *   Include error handling and logging.
*   **API Configuration:** Update environment variables in the backend to point to the new MongoDB connection string.

**Rollback Plan:**

*   **M1.1:** Revert the frontend configuration change.
*   **M1.2:** The new MongoDB instance can be dropped without affecting the (already corrupted) `careers.db`.
*   **M1.3:** Revert the API configuration changes to point back to the old data sources.

**Risk Mitigation:**

*   **Risk:** `production_career_data.json` is unavailable or corrupted.
    *   **Mitigation:** Use the last known good backup of this file. The analysis confirmed its high quality, so this risk is low.
*   **Risk:** The recovery script fails.
    *   **Mitigation:** The script will be designed to be idempotent. Manually inspect logs and resolve issues before re-running.

### Phase 2: Architecture Consolidation and Unification (Duration: 1 Week)

**Objective:** Establish a single, unified MongoDB architecture as the source of truth, standardize the data schema, and create a robust data migration and validation pipeline.

**Milestones:**

| Milestone | Deliverable | Success Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| **M2.1: Unified Schema Definition** | A formal schema definition document (e.g., in JSON Schema or a markdown file) for the `careers` collection in MongoDB. | The schema is approved by stakeholders and covers all required fields, data types, and validation rules. |
| **M2.2: Data Migration Pipeline** | A set of scripts (`scripts/migrate_and_validate.py`) to migrate data from any future data sources into the unified MongoDB schema. | The pipeline can successfully ingest data, transform it to the new schema, and validate it against the defined rules. |
| **M2.3: Deprecation of Old Data Sources** | All code references to `careers.db` and `new_career_data.json` are removed from the codebase. | The project is completely decoupled from the old, fragmented data sources. |

**Technical Specifications:**

*   **Schema:** The unified schema will be based on the structure of `production_career_data.json`, with enhancements for data quality (e.g., required fields, enum constraints).
*   **Migration Pipeline:**
    *   Use Python with libraries like `pandas` for data transformation and `jsonschema` for validation.
    *   The pipeline will be designed to be extensible for future data sources.
*   **Code Refactoring:** A thorough search of the codebase will be conducted to identify and remove all references to the old data sources.

**Rollback Plan:**

*   **M2.1:** Revert to the implicit schema of `production_career_data.json`.
*   **M2.2:** The migration pipeline is not mission-critical for the already-restored data. Development can be paused or reverted.
*   **M2.3:** Revert the code refactoring changes from version control.

**Risk Mitigation:**

*   **Risk:** Schema definition is incomplete.
    *   **Mitigation:** Involve domain experts and developers in the schema design process.
*   **Risk:** Data loss during migration.
    *   **Mitigation:** The migration pipeline will be tested extensively in a staging environment before running in production.

### Phase 3: Data Quality Enhancement and Monitoring (Duration: 2-4 Weeks)

**Objective:** Implement systems for monitoring data quality, enhancing the production dataset, and establishing a continuous improvement feedback loop.

**Milestones:**

| Milestone | Deliverable | Success Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| **M3.1: Data Quality Dashboard** | A monitoring dashboard (e.g., using Grafana, Kibana, or a custom solution) displaying key data quality KPIs. | The dashboard provides real-time insights into data completeness, consistency, and accuracy. |
| **M3.2: Alerting System** | An automated alerting system that notifies the development team of data quality anomalies. | Alerts are triggered for events like schema violations, missing data, or significant changes in data distribution. |
| **M3.3: Data Enhancement Pipeline** | A process for enriching the existing career data with additional information (e.g., from external APIs or manual curation). | The production dataset is enhanced with new, high-quality data points, improving the user experience. |
| **M3.4: Continuous Improvement Process** | A documented process for ongoing data quality assurance, including regular reviews and feedback loops. | A sustainable process is in place to maintain and improve data quality over time. |

**Technical Specifications:**

*   **Monitoring:**
    *   Use MongoDB's change streams to capture real-time data changes.
    *   A separate service will process these changes and update the monitoring dashboard.
*   **Alerting:**
    *   Integrate with tools like PagerDuty or Slack for notifications.
*   **Data Enhancement:**
    *   Develop scripts to interact with external APIs (e.g., for salary data, job trends).
    *   Create a simple admin interface for manual data curation.

**Rollback Plan:**

*   **M3.1 & M3.2:** The monitoring and alerting systems are non-intrusive and can be disabled without affecting the core application.
*   **M3.3:** Data enhancements will be performed on a staging environment first. A backup of the production database will be taken before applying any enhancements.
*   **M3.4:** The continuous improvement process is a workflow and can be adjusted as needed.

**Risk Mitigation:**

*   **Risk:** External APIs for data enhancement are unreliable.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement circuit breakers and caching to handle API failures gracefully.
*   **Risk:** Monitoring system creates excessive noise.
    *   **Mitigation:** Fine-tune alerting thresholds and rules based on initial observations.
